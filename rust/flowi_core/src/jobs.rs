//! Safe front-end over flowi core's work-stealing job system (`fl_jobs_*`).
//!
//! [`Jobs::add`] boxes a Rust closure, passes it through an extern "C" trampoline
//! that reclaims and runs it exactly once, and returns a [`JobHandle`] to query or
//! wait on.
//!
//! A scheduled closure runs on a worker thread at an unknown later time, so it must
//! be Send + 'static and may not borrow from the call site. A panic inside it is
//! caught at the FFI boundary and logged at error level; the job fails to finish its
//! work rather than aborting the process.
//!
//! Only the main thread can block on a handle. [`Jobs::wait`] returns straight away
//! everywhere else, so a job body that needs ordering expresses it with
//! [`Jobs::add_after`] rather than by waiting.
//!
//! These calls operate on the process-global job system and do not bring it up.
//! Application::new, Application::embedded or a bare [`crate::init`] does that once
//! at startup; scheduling before then panics. Creating and destroying the system is
//! the runtime's responsibility, not part of this safe surface.
