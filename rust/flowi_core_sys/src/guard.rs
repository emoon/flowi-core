//! Panic containment at the C→Rust boundary.
//!
//! Every extern "C" entry a plugin exports wraps its body in [`ffi_guard`]: a
//! Rust panic must never unwind across the C ABI. On a caught panic the guard logs
//! the payload through the installed panic logger (see [`set_panic_logger`]),
//! poisons the plugin, and returns the caller-supplied error value for this slot.
//!
//! Poison is process-global and terminal for the plugin's lifetime: every subsequent
//! guarded entry early-returns its error slot without running its body. A host that
//! reloads the plugin clears it via [`clear_poison`].
//!
//! A plugin cdylib must be built with the unwind panic strategy (the workspace
//! default) so [`ffi_guard`]'s catch_unwind can contain the panic.
